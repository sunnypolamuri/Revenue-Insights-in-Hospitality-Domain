# Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-Domain

# Introduction:
"Revenue Insights in Hospitality" is a data analysis project focused on providing comprehensive insights into the revenue patterns within the hospitality industry. This project leverages Power BI to visualize and analyze key metrics, trends, and factors that influence revenue in the hospitality sector.

# Prerequisites:

  Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:
  
  1.Microsoft Power BI Desktop
  
  2.A compatible operating system (Windows 10 or later)
  
  3.Basic knowledge of Power BI and data visualization

# File Description:
Revenue Insights in Hospitality.pbix: This is the main Power BI file containing all the data models, reports, and visualizations related to the project.

# Installation:

  1.Download Power BI Desktop: If you don't already have Power BI Desktop installed, download it from the official Power BI 
  website.
  
  2.Clone the Repository: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
  "git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Revenue-Insights-Hospitality.git"
  
  3.Open the PBIX File: Launch Power BI Desktop and open the Revenue Insights in Hospitality.pbix file from the cloned 
  repository or the downloaded file location.

# Features:

  Revenue Analysis: Detailed analysis of revenue streams, including seasonal trends, geographical distribution, and service- 
  specific performance.

  Performance Metrics: Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as occupancy rates, average daily rate (ADR), and revenue per 
  available room (RevPAR).

  Trend Analysis: Visualization of historical trends and future projections based on existing data.

  Comparative Analysis: Comparison of revenue metrics across different time periods, regions, and segments within the 
  hospitality industry.

# DAX Measures:
Below are some of the key DAX measures used in this project:

  1.Total Revenue:

  Total Revenue = SUM('Revenue'[Amount])

  2.Average Daily Rate (ADR):

  Average Daily Rate:

  ADR = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], SUM('Room Nights'[Nights]))

  3.Occupancy Rate:

  Occupancy Rate:

  Occupancy Rate = DIVIDE(SUM('Room Nights'[Occupied Nights]), SUM('Room Nights'[Available Nights]))

  4.Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR):

  RevPAR(Revenue Per Available Room):

  RevPAR = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], SUM('Room Nights'[Available Rooms]))

  5.Year-over-Year Revenue Growth:

  YoY Revenue Growth:

  YoY Revenue Growth = 
  DIVIDE(
    [Total Revenue] - CALCULATE([Total Revenue], DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR)),
    CALCULATE([Total Revenue], DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR))
  )

# Usage:

  1.Load the Data: Ensure that all necessary data sources are accessible. If the PBIX file requires external data 
  connections, make sure those are properly configured and accessible from your Power BI setup.

  2.Explore the Reports: Navigate through the various report pages to explore different aspects of the revenue insights. 
  Each page contains visualizations and data points that highlight specific metrics and trends.

  3.Interact with the Visualizations: Use filters, slicers, and other interactive elements to drill down into the data and 
  gain deeper insights.

  4.Customize the Reports: Feel free to modify the visualizations, add new data sources, or customize the reports to better 
  fit your specific needs.
